# SorryDB Agent development checklist

This is an artificial lean 4 project containing a number of sorried statements.
It intends to help with the development of SorryDB agents. 

The sorries in this project are *easy* from the point of view of automated
theorem proving, but represent individual engineering issues that may occur when
attempting to automatically fill sorries 'in the wild'.

See [Checklist.lean](Checklist/Checklist.lean) for the list of sorries.


## Branches

The repository contains two branches:

- `main`: including comments with the "solutions", as well as some explanation
- `checklist`: stripped of comments, so that agents do not have access to them

The `checklist` branch is automatically generated by a CI workflow. 


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you encounter (recurring) engineering issues that
in using automation to fill Lean sorries in real-world projects, feel free to make a PR.

Requirements:

1. Only `Prop`-valued sorries without metavariables (holes)
2. Please submit minimal working examples, so that each sorry represents a
   unique difficulty; ideally the 'proving' itself should be as easy as possible
3. Please include a proof string in the comments (replacing "sorry" with this
   string should close the sorry)
